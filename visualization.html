                             <p>The CEC collects data on wind power generation data from power plants across California. My team was interested in democratizing this information to the public through an intuitive and comprehensive product. To do this we developed a web application that would show each plants physical location in California along with a color coded bar which would change length in proportion to the electricity generated by the plant in a given month. We also added an animation feature that would continuously loop through all months in the dataset.
								The visualization is a 3D render and has interactive buttons that toggle different views for the data including, the major wind power regions in the state for the year, as well as specialty off-shore plants.
							 </p> 
								<p>The software is written in primarily in JavaScript and HTML. We used the Qgis2threejs plugin to render the base California map and to plot the plant locations onto the render. The first problem we encountered was that the raw power generation values that the plants reported ranged from 0 up to 100,000+. Using this distribution made all bars in the visualization so tall that they would span the whole page, leaving the product incoherent. To solve this we renormalized the distribution down to a numerical interval of 0 to 75. We achieved this by assigning adjustment factors to each plant based on their relative capacity to produce electricity. This allowed the large plants to show up as tall bars while not completely stomping out the smaller plants that power California's energy grid.</p>
								<p>As the lead developer, I wrote all documentation for the web application and created a toolchain for future developers to quickly update the visualization with data from future years. This was done with a combination of Python and JavaScript to parse the raw data from our API's. I also automated the data augmentation process with an Excel sheet that would take our Excel data stores and automatically compute the renormalized data values from the output of the low level scripts. From here, the update process becomes a simple copy and paste with minor adjustments to the HTML.</p>
								<p>The application is hosted on the CEC's official website. See the visualization <mark style="background-color:greenyellow;"><a href="https://repository.energy.ca.gov/3D_Visualizations/2014-2022_Monthly_Visualization/2014-2022_monthly.html">here</a></mark>.</p>
