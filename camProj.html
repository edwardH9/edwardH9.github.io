								<p>Prices for home surveillance systems are very high, and may only keep growing. Some services require customers to pay monthly for coverage, which further compounds the expenses of securing property. To make surveilance easier and more affordable, I decided to make a security system using ESP32 Cam modules.</p>
								<h3>How the system works</h3>
								<p>The ESP32 Cam is a microcontroller that has WiFi capabilties and an OV2640 camera to record video and capture still images. The code for this module, relies on these two fundamental properties of the device. The ESP32 Cam first begins recording upon being powered on. Simulatenous with this, the WiFi chip begins to scan for networks in the area. Once it finds a network that it has been coded to recognize, the ESP32 Cam connects to the network and streams the image to a specific IP address on that network.
									The user can then use any computer in the same network, and view the live stream on any monitor of choice by accessing that IP.
									<br> <p>I also added solar power circuitry to this project. This circuitry has necessary battery protections and will allow the cameras to operate 24/7 without the need to take out and recharge the batteries. The main battery is a set of 18650 Lithium Ion batteries coupled to a Lithium battery solar charger IC. This IC is non-MPPT and has been adjusted to the proper charging current for 18650 batteries. The solar cell that provides the recharging energy is a 300mA 5V panel. In times of sufficient sunlight, this panel is capable of bypassing the battery and powering the camera directly. This improves battery life by reducing unnecessary frequent cycling of the battery.

								<h3>Improvements</h3>
								<p>I'm developing this project to have more features than just simply viewing the camera's video stream. The following functionality is under development now:
									<li>Motion Activated Image Capturing</li>
									<li>Storage of images on an external MicroSD card</li>
									<li>Smart file management system (Delete old photos and keep new ones)</li>
									<li>And More</li>
